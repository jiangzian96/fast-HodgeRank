# fast-HodgeRank
A MATLAB implementation of the methods I have used in my senior thesis. Partially collaborated with Prof. Xiaozhe Hu (http://math.tufts.edu/faculty/xhu/)

* Successive Subspace Correction
* HodgeRank problem
* Graph matching
* Conjugate Gradient 
* Row sampling for linear least-squares problem
* Spectral graph theory
* Algebraic Multigrid method (AMG)
